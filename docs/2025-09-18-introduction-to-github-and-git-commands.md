# Introduction to GitHub and Git Commands (2025-09-18)
This note summarizes my experience with learning GitHub and practicing Git commands, which provided a nice introduction to version control and collaboration. The hands-on experience with Git commands in a local environment and observing the output on the GitHub UI was particularly insightful.

Learning about GitHub and Git involves understanding the basics of version control, creating repositories, and managing changes to code or documents. It includes using commands to initialize, add, commit, and push changes to a repository, as well as understanding how these changes are reflected on the GitHub platform. This knowledge is essential for developers and collaborators to work efficiently on projects. The process of executing these commands locally and seeing the immediate effects on the GitHub UI helps in grasping the concept of distributed version control systems.

What I learned:
* How to initialize a Git repository locally
* Basic Git commands such as add, commit, and push
* How to create and manage repositories on GitHub
* Understanding the concept of version control and its importance in collaborative projects
* Observing changes in the GitHub UI after executing local Git commands
